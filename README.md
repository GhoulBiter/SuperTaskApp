### Purpose
To provide a minimalistic app with a simple design that will allow users to keep track of their tasks. One of the main reasons that users generally find difficulty with similar apps is that there are too many options. Many times, it is better to have a simple listing without over-complication. Generally, in these cases, users tend to open the notes app on their phone to do this task but such note apps tend to become convoluted with enough notes being added.
Therefore, this app aims to solve this issue promptly without overly bombarding the user with excessive features.

### How to Use:
1) Download the files from the repository
1) Open the CLI in the root directory with the package.lock file
1) Run the command "npm install"
1) Run the command "npx expo start"
